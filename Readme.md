A playful, visual learning series that teaches **LangGraph, LLMs, agents, and tools** through the story of **Sam**, a curious traveler in the magical village of **Harmonyville**.

Each episode is a Jupyter notebook that evolves Sam’s journey, introducing one new LangGraph concept at a time — from memory to tools, to routing, to agents.
